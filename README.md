# Rive Animation for Flutter: A Beginner's Guide to Creating Stunning Animations with Ease !

Animations typically increase the visual appeal of an app or website and improves overall engagement of the users. According to a study by Forrester Research, websites with well-executed animations, experience an increase in user engagement by up to 400%. Engaging animations can capture users' attention and encourage them to interact more with the platform. However, there is a learning curve for developers to master animation, especially when working with more advanced animation tools and techniques.

Grasping Rive as a developer with no experience in animation can be relatively easy compared to other animation tools or frameworks. Rive (formerly known as Flare) is designed to be user-friendly and accessible to developers, even those with little or no prior animation experience.
